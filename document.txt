There are totally 4 rest api mapping method in our controller,
and for each method in controller, we call service method, then we use
a static list of books to pretend data from database.

localhost:8080/allBooks
get mapping
retrieve all books in our list as a list in json format;


localhost:8080/getByAuthor/{author_name}:
get mapping
retrieve all books in our list with same author's name as a list in json format;


localhost:8080/getByTitle/{partial title}:
get mapping
retrieve all books in our list with partial title matched as a list in json format;


localhost:8080/addBook:
post mapping
send a json to backend side, such as:
{
	"id":10,
	"title":"new",
	"author":"newAu"
}	
retrieve all books in our list as a list in json format;
